    <p>I'm  a computer science undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin. I like Linux, Vim, and discrete mathematics.</p>
    <p>I am an active member of the Dublin University Internet Society (Netsoc). I was the Netsoc Public Relations Officer for 2019/2020 and I have been elected as the Secretary of the society for 2020/2021. Netsoc hold various events on web development and computer networking, and they maintain their own web servers to provide various services to their members.</p>
    <p>I was also recently elected as the PRO of the DU Pirate Party. The Pirate Party has talks on things like privacy, internet security and open source, as well as organising various CTF events.</p>
    <p>I am also helping to organise SISTEM 2021, a tech conference run by students, for students. This year sistem will take place on the 20th of February, via the online platform Hopin. Tickets cost â‚¬5, and all proceeds will go to Pieta House and the Irish Network Against Racism.<p>
