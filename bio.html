    <p>I'm  a computer science undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in networks, cryptography, probability and statistics.</p>
    <p>I am an active member of the <a href=https://netsoc.ie >Dublin University Internet Society (Netsoc)</a>. I was the Netsoc Public Relations Officer for 2019/2020 and I have been elected as the Secretary of the society for 2020/2021. Netsoc hold various events on web development and computer networking, and they maintain their own web servers to provide various services to their members.</p>
    <p>I was also recently elected as the PRO of the <a href=https://pirates.ie >DU Pirate Party</a>. The Pirate Party has talks on things like privacy, internet security and open source, as well as organising various CTF events.</p>
    <p>I also helped to organise <a href=https://sistemconf.com >SISTEM 2021</a>, a tech conference run by students, for students. SISTEM 2021 took place on the 20th of February 2021, via the online platform Hopin. We ended up raising â‚¬2200 from ticket sales for our chosen charities <a href=https://pieta.ie >Pieta House</a> and the <a href=https://inar.ie >Irish Network Against Racism</a>.<p>
