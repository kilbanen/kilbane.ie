    </div>
    <p>I love basketball, and I often like to look up the stats of players and teams on 
    <a href=https://www.basketball-reference.com/>basketball-reference.com</a>.
    So I'm currently writing some Bash scripts to easily retrieve information from the website and 
    display it in the terminal.</p>
    <div class="projecttitle">
      <img src="calculator.svg" alt="Calculator Icon" width="100" height="100">
      <h2><a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/Calculator>Calculator</a></h2>
    </div>
    <p>I made a simple calculator app to teach myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    You can open it in a browser and do basic arithmetic operations.</p>
    <div class="projecttitle">
      <img src="scrabble.svg" alt="Scrabble Icon" width="100" height="100">
      <h2><a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/Scrabble_Anagram_Solver>Scrabble Anagram Solver</a></h2>
    </div>
    <p>This is a C program that I wrote to determine every word that can be made from a set of
    Scrabble tiles.
    It even incorporates blank tiles!
    Of course, there is absolutely no way you would be allowed to use this in a real game of 
    Scrabble, so this is just for your own curiosity. 
    You could also use it for the words rounds on Countdown, or finding anagrams of your own name.</p>
    <div class="projecttitle">
      <img src="connect4.svg" alt="Connect 4 Icon" width="100" height="100">
      <h2><a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/arm-assembly-connect-4>Connect 4</a></h2>
    </div>
    <p>This is an implementation of Connect 4 written in ARM assembly language that I wrote for an 
    assignment in my first year of college. 
    You can play against another person, or against my <b>extremely primitive</b> AI.
