    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>Bashketball Reference</h2>
    <p>I love basketball, and I often like to look up the stats of players and teams on <a href=https://www.basketball-reference.com/>basketball-reference.com</a>. So I'm currently writing some Bash scripts to easily retrieve information from the website and display it in the terminal. <a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/Basketball_Reference_CLI>Check out the code here.</a></p>

    <h2>Scrabble Anagram Solver</h2>
    <p>This is a C program that I wrote to determine every word that can be made from a set of Scrabble tiles. It even incorporates blank tiles! Of course, there is absolutely no way you would be allowed to use this in a real game of Scrabble, so this is just for your own curiosity. You could also use it for the words rounds on Countdown, or finding anagrams of your own name. <a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/Scrabble_Anagram_Solver>Check out the code here.</a></p>
