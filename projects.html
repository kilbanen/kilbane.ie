    <h2>Scrabble Anagram Solver</h2>
    <p>This is a C program that I wrote to determine every word that can be made from a set of Scrabble tiles. It even incorporates blank tiles! Of course, there is absolutely no way you would be allowed to use this in a real game of Scrabble, so this is just for your own curiosity. You could also use it for the words rounds on Countdown, or finding anagrams of your own name. <a href=https://gitlab.com/Kilbane/Scrabble_Anagram_Solver>Check out the code here.</a></p>
